Welcome to Beep Boop Click, my new site for discussing some of my journey in 3D Printing. I've been working with some printers over the years, but I've just gotten a [LulzBot Mini](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S54E1AI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00S54E1AI&linkCode=as2&tag=egowaffle&linkId=ZOLXXNLWNKQXXJ3J)<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=egowaffle&l=as2&o=1&a=B00S54E1AI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 (Amazon Affiliate Link), which is their brand-new model. 


Indeed, it's a new line for them, as Aleph Objects has mostly stuck with the Taz line until now. Which is important, because while there's a bunch of knowledge out there for the Taz line, the Mini has some cool new features like the auto-leveling bed, and it has a new form factor, different motherboard, and all the little things that make it harder for people to use the information that already exists. So I figured I would document what I learn here.

I'm also using Simplify3D for my slicing, which means transferring all the existing profiles for [Cura](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura) into [Simplify3D](https://www.simplify3d.com) and learning what sorts of cool things I can do with that for a better slicing experience. As I create those profiles, I'll go ahead and put them in a convenient location on the site. Hopefully I can give people a better idea of if Simplify3D is worth the $150 (it is for me, and probably is for you) as there's no free trial, so it's a big leap to go from the Free/Open Source tools to something like that.

Of course, when I make 3D models, I will share them on various sites and talk about them here.

Finally, as of when I purchased, just about the only videos that I could find for the LulzBot Mini were printing out the [Rocktopus](https://www.lulzbot.com/rocktopus), so I think it would be worthwhile adding a bunch of videos as well. 

So welcome again, and let's see what sorts of trouble we can get into with 3D Printing, shall we?

This is the [Black Bear (28mm scale for D&D/tabletop games)](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:561286) by [Matthew Meyer](http://www.thingiverse.com/osarusan/about). Though obviously more of a blue bear here.
